Unihack x BCU – Terratech Project

Birmingham Neighbourhood Sustainability Dashboard

A lightweight and accessible dashboard that analyses open environmental data (air quality, noise pollution, and green-space access) to generate a Sustainability Score for every neighbourhood across Birmingham, UK.

This project empowers residents, councils, researchers, and community groups to understand the environmental health of local areas at a glance.

Why This Matters

Cities collect environmental data — but it’s often scattered, inconsistent, and hard to interpret.

Our dashboard brings it all together so anyone can quickly see:
	•	How clean the air is
	•	How noisy the area is
	•	How much green space is available
	•	Which neighbourhoods are healthiest
	•	Where improvements are needed (future development)

This contributes to key goals in environmental justice, public health, and smart urban planning.

Core Features

Sustainability Score per Neighbourhood

Combines air, noise, and green-access into a single easy-to-read score (0–100).

⸻

Air Quality
	•	Uses PM2.5, PM10, and NO₂ values
	•	Converts them into a normalised 0–100 score

⸻

Noise Pollution
	•	Noise levels mapped across Birmingham
	•	Converted into a liveability score

⸻

Green Space Accessibility
	•	High / Medium / Low accessibility
	•	Based on proximity to major parks or green corridors

⸻

Dataset Integration
	•	All environmental metrics combined using
postcode → district mapping
