# Unihack-x-BCU-Terratech-Project

A simple and accessible dashboard that analyses open environmental datasets (air quality, noise pollution, and green spaces) to generate a sustainability score for each neighbourhood across Birmingham UK.

📖This project helps residents, local councils, and community groups understand how healthy and liveable different areas are at a glance.


Features:

- Neighbourhood Sustainability Score
- Green Space Coverage Analysis
- Air Quality Monitoring
- Noise Level Insights
- Comparison View for multiple neighbourhoods (future enhancements)
- What If Panel (future enhancement)

Final Output Example:

{
  "postcode": "B1 1AA",
  "air_score": 62,
  "noise_score": 48,
  "green_score": 72,
  "sustainability_score": 61
}
