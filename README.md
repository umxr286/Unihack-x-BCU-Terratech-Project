Unihack x BCU – Terratech Project

Birmingham Neighbourhood Sustainability Dashboard

A lightweight and accessible dashboard that analyses open environmental data (air quality, noise pollution, and green-space access) to generate a Sustainability Score for every neighbourhood across Birmingham, UK.

This project empowers residents, councils, researchers, and community groups to understand the environmental health of local areas at a glance.

Why This Matters?
Cities collect environmental data — but it’s scattered and hard to understand.

Our dashboard brings it together so anyone can quickly see:
	- How clean the air is
	- How noisy the area is
	- How much green space is available
	- Which neighbourhoods are healthiest 
	- Where improvements are needed (future development)

This contributes to goals around environmental justice, public health, and urban planning.

Core Features:

Sustainability Score per Neighbourhood:

- Combines air, noise, and green-access into a single easy-to-read score (0–100):

Air Quality:

- PM2.5, PM10, NO₂ data transformed into a normalised score:

Noise Pollution

- Noise levels mapped across Birmingham and converted into a liveability score:

 Green Space Accessibility

- High/Medium/Low green access rating based on proximity to major parks/green corridors:

 Dataset Integration:

- All environmental metrics merged using postcode → district mapping:

Future Improvements:

 Live Data Integration:
	- Real-time air quality and noise updates
	- Automatic daily refresh of sustainability scores

 Machine Learning Enhancements:
	- Predict future environmental health
	- Identify at-risk neighbourhoods

 What-If Simulation Panel:
	- Add trees → how much score improves?
	- Reduce traffic → noise score impact
	- Add cycle lanes → air quality effect

 Mobile App Version:
	- On-the-go environmental health insights
